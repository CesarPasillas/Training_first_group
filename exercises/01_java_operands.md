## Indications

### Please follow the below instructions: 
Create a pacakge that starts with com then your name and finally the exercises operands
example: 
  **com.[your_name].exercises.operands**

The classes should have the prefix 01 , 02, 03, etc. followed by the "_" underscore In the class name, we know that is not recommend but is only to identify the exercises.
example:
  #### 01_ClassOne
  #### 02_SumTwoNums
  #### 03_Conversions

## Exercises

### Exercises java Operands
**01 Perform an Java mathematical Operation**
Create a menu in the console with the next options:
  * 1 - (+) Sum two nums
  * 2 - (-) Substraction of two nums
  * 3 - (*) Multiplication of two nums
  * 4 - (/) Division of two nums 
  * 5 - (%) Module of two nums

You need to request to the user the number of the option to perform the operation that is displayed, then you need to request the two numbers and return the result of that operation.

##### Constrain: you need to handle the exception of the DIvision of 0.
 


**02 Convert Kilograms to pounds, ounces, grams**
Create am algoritm that converts the Kilograms into pounds, ounces, grams, and tons. Request to the iuser the kilograms that should beconverted in the other Measures of weight

**Example:** 
If I the user sends 1 Kg you need to retrieve in the console the next messages:
- 1 Kg = 2.20462 pounds
- 1 kg = 35.274 ounces
- 1 kg = 1000 grams
- 1 kg = 0.00110231 tons


**03 Calculate the percentage**
Create an algorithm that will calculate the percentage especified of a number, you need to request the percentage to the user and then you need to request the number you want to get the percentage of

**Example**
If the user send the 10% of 1000 the result will be 100

**04 Determine the bigest of three numbers**
Create an algorithm that request three numbers and indicates wich of them is the bigger.

**Example**
If the user send the 5, 100 and -1 the message taht should be returned must be similar like this "THe biggest number is 100"


**05 Convert an int into a char**
Create an algorithm that shows the char value of an int.

Request to a user an int number and display the char value of that int number.

**Example**
If the user introduces 97 then the program should shoe the letter 'a'

**06 Transform an String into a number**
Create an algorithm that transforms a String into a number.
The user should provide a number that holds only 5 digits, if the user introduces more that 5 digits the number must be truncate to have only 5 numbers.

**Example**
If the user introduces "12378" then the program should return the number 12378
if the user introduces "123789045" the the program should return the number 12378

**Constraint**
If the user introduces characters they need to return the next message: "is number invalid"

**07 Transform an String into a number II**
Create an algorithm that transforms a String into a number.
The user should provide an String and we need to transform it into a number, including the characters

**Example**
If the user introduces "12378" then the program should return the number 12378
if the user introduces "123789045" the the program should return the number 123789045
if the user introduces "123a" the user need to return 12397

**08 sum the digits of a number**
Create an algorithm that sums the digits of a number.
The user should provide an String with numbers and they need to sum each of their digits of the number provided 

**Example**
If the user introduces "12378" then the program should return the number 21
if the user introduces "123789045" the the program should return the number 39
if the user introduces "123a" the user need to return 103

you need to hav ein consideration the chars.
