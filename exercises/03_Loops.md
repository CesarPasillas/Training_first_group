## Indications

### Please follow the below instructions: 
Create a pacakge that starts with com then your name and finally the exercises operands
example: 
  **com.[your_name].exercises.secuence_control**

The classes should have the prefix 01 , 02, 03, etc. followed by the "_" underscore In the class name, we know that is not recommend but is only to identify the exercises.
example:
  #### 01_ClassOne
  #### 02_SumTwoNums
  #### 03_Conversions

## Exercises

### Exercises java Operands
### Exercises Loops
**01 THe piramid**
Create an algorithm that Prints an piramid in the console using the loops, the user will be able to intorduce the height to create the piramid.

**Example**
If the user introduces a 5, then the piramid  should be 
- A 
- A A 
- A A A 
- A A A A 
- A A A A A 

  
**Challenge**
you need create three algorthms each one with the for-loop, while, and do while.


**02 Inverted Piramid**
Create an algorithm that Prints an inverted piramid in the console using the loops, the user will be able to intorduce the height to create the piramid.

**Example**
If the user introduces a 9 an odd number the last piramid level will be only with one character, then the piramid should be 
- AAAAAAAAA  
-  AAAAAAA 
-   AAAAA 
-    AAA 
-     A

If the user introduces a 10 an pair number the last piramid level will be with two characters, then the piramid should be 
- AAAAAAAAAA
-  AAAAAAAA
-   AAAAAA
-    AAAA
-     AA
-     
  
**Challenge**
you need create three algorthms each one with the for-loop, while, and do while.


**03 The M**
Create an algoritm that prints the letter M with 'M' characters using the loops

- M   M
- MM MM
- M M M
- M   M
- M   M

**Challenge**
you need create three algorthms each one with the for-loop, while, and do while.


**04 Print the odds in a range of n to m numbers**
Create an algorithm that prints the odds numbers from a especified range provided by the user, the user must introduce the ranges 1-50, and the program should print the odd numbers in the range 1 to 50.

**Example**
if the user introduces 1-5
then the console should print the numbers 1, 3, 5

**Challenge**
You need create three algorthms each one with the for-loop, while, and do while.

**05 sum all numbers introduced by the user**
Create an algorithm that requests number to create an accumulated sum, until the user introduces a char or letter.

**Challenge**
You need create three algorthms each one with the for-loop, while, and do while.


**06 Print the String provided by the user 'n' times**
Create an algorithm that request an String to be printed the N times that the user want to be printed.

**Challenge**
You need create three algorthms each one with the for-loop, while, and do while.

**07 Print the String and the size of the String**
Create an algorithm that request 6 string and after thatm th eprogrma must print the string and their size

**example**
- If the user introduces the String "El Miaus" then in the console must print "El Miaus - 8"

**Challenge**
You need create three algorthms each one with the for-loop, while, and do while.

**08 Improved the Java mathematical Operation**
Create a menu in the console with the next options:
  * 1 - (+) Sum two nums
  * 2 - (-) Substraction of two nums
  * 3 - (*) Multiplication of two nums
  * 4 - (/) Division of two nums 
  * 5 - (%) Module of two nums

You need to request to the user the number of the option to perform the operation that is displayed, then you need to request the two numbers and return the result of that operation.

The program will end until the user introduces in any moment the values of "q", ":q", "exit" and "Quit", also this words will not be case sensitive.
##### Constrain: you need to handle the exception of the DIvision of 0.

**Challenge**
You need create three algorthms each one with the for-loop, while, and do while.
