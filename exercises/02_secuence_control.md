## Indications

### Please follow the below instructions: 
Create a pacakge that starts with com then your name and finally the exercises operands
example: 
  **com.[your_name].exercises.secuence_control**

The classes should have the prefix 01 , 02, 03, etc. followed by the "_" underscore In the class name, we know that is not recommend but is only to identify the exercises.
example:
  #### 01_ClassOne
  #### 02_SumTwoNums
  #### 03_Conversions

## Exercises

### Exercises Secuence Control
**01 Calcule the discont of the ticket based on the age**
Create an algorithm that calculates the price of the ticket base on the below table:

- < 5 years the ticket has 50% of discont 
- > 5 and < 12 years the ticket has 30% of discont 
- > 12 and < 60 years the ticket has 0% of discount
- > 60 years the ticket has 50 % of discount


You need to request to the user the age to get the discount and show in return
  
**Challenge**
you need create two algorthms onr that uses the if-else and the other for the Switch case

**02 Calculate the grades**
Request the points of 5 subjects to calculate the grades of the students

if the percentage is above 90, assign grade A
if the percentage is above 75, assign grade B
if the percentage is above 65, assign grade C

**Challenge**
you need create two algorthms onr that uses the if-else and the other for the Switch case


**03 Calculate the size of the t-shirts**
Create an algorithm that calculate the size of the t-shirts, this algorithm shoud request the number of the T-shirt to calculte the correct size of the T-shirt using the below table:

29 = "Small";
42 = "Medium";
44 = "Large";
48 = "Extra Large";
any other number = "Unknown"


**Challenge**
you need create two algorthms onr that uses the if-else and the other for the Switch case

**04 calculate the day of the wee**
Create an algorithm that request a number and return the value of the day.

**Example**
If the user send the 1, the should return Sunday
if the user sends the 7, the shoukd return Saturday

**Challenge**
you need create two algorthms onr that uses the if-else and the other for the Switch case


**05 Return the days of the month**
Create an algorithm thats returns days of the month.

Request to the user the nme of the month and return days of the month. In this case the program must don't do any distiction between capital and lower letters.

**Example**
If the user send January the program shoukd return "30"
if the user sends december the program shoukd return "31"
If the user introduces january if should be the same as JANUARY or JanuaRY.

**Constraint**
For the February Month the days should be 28

**Challenge**
you need create two algorthms onr that uses the if-else and the other for the Switch case

**06 Indicate if the character is a Vowel or a constant**
Create an algorithm that indicates if the character introduced by the user is a vowel or a consonant.

**Example**
If the user introduces "a" then the program should return the number "Vowel"
if the user introduces "E" the the program should return the number "Vowel"
if the user introduces "X" the the program should return the number "Consonant"
if the user introduces "z" the the program should return the number "Consonant"

**Challenge**
you need create two algorthms onr that uses the if-else and the other for the Switch case


**07 Calculate the subjects based in the year that I will get assigned**
Create an algorithm that indicates wich will be your subject based on the years in the school and especialization, request to the user the college year, this can be from 1 to 4 and the especialization it can be C, E, M the below table to calculate the subjects:

- year 1 - subjects : "English, Maths, Science"
- year 2 - especialization C : "Operating System, Java, Data Structure"
- year 2 - especialization E : "Micro processors, Logic switching theory"
- year 2 - especialization M : "Drawing, Manufacturing Machines"
- year 3 - especialization C : "Computer Organization, MultiMedia"
- year 3 - especialization E : "Fundamentals of Logic Design, Microelectronics"
- year 3 - especialization M : "Internal Combustion Engines, Mechanical Vibration"
- year 4 - especialization C : "Data Communication and Networks, MultiMedia"
- year 4 - especialization E : "Embedded System, Image Processing"
- year 4 - especialization M : "Production Technology, Thermal Engineering"

**Example**
If the user introduces "1" then the program should return the number "English, Maths, Science"
if the user introduces "3E" the the program should return the number "Fundamentals of Logic Design, Microelectronics"

**Challenge**
you need create two algorthms onr that uses the if-else and the other for the Switch case


**08 calculate if the String is odd or not**
Create an algorithm that indicates if the number of their characters is odd or pair
The user should provide an String with "n" characters and we need to count it and return if is odd or pair.

**Challenge**
you need create two algorthms onr that uses the if-else and the other for the Switch case
